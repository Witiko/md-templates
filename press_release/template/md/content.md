# Attention everyone!

This is an example document of the template, showing its options that can be toggled using the YAML metadata. `Phone, email, address,` and `url` are optional, replace their value with an empty string (`''`) if they're not used to suppress them in the output.

Options available:

- title: Title of the document in the header
- author: Author's (pen)name
- booktitle: Title of the book
- phone: (Public) phone number
- email: (Public) email address
- address: (Public) address
- url: Link to a website

In case the `image` directory contains a `logo` file that file is typeset in the upper right corner of the letter page (first page). If not, it is replaced by the author's name.

Here you can show of the things

- [X] you have done
- [.] you have *almost* finished

and you can omit the things

- [ ] you have not started yet
