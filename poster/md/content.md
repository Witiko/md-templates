# Nom de Plume Talks About a New Book

![](portrait.jpg)

This is an example document of the template, showing its options that can be toggled using the YAML metadata. `Phone, email, address,` and `url` are optional, replace their value with an empty string (`''`) if they're not used to suppress them in the output.

Options available:

- title: Title of the document in the header
- author: Author's (pen)name
- phone: (Public) phone number
- email: (Public) email address
- address: (Public) address
- url: Link to a website

In case the `image` directory contains a `logo` file that file is typeset in the upper right corner of the letter page (first page). If not, it is replaced by the author's name. Images in the document will be typeset on the right handside with text wrapping around it.

"A very cool book I like a lot."
