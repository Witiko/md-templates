# Markdown? In my LaTeX?
This repository contains a number of LaTeX templates utilising the [witiko/markdown](https://github.com/witiko/markdown) package with the goal to separate the form from the content and enable the users to focus on their writings, instead of trying to figure out the formatting.

To typeset an example document, simply navigate to the template directory you want to use and call

`latexmk -lualatex example.tex`

The development of these templates has been a part of the research project [MUNI/33/0776/2021](https://www.muni.cz/en/research/projects/62168), funded by the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University.
